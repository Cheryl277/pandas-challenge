Analysis:

There seemed to be a correlation between the schools' size and the overall passing rate 
of test scores. Small/Medium school size has a higher passing than Large school size. It could be that smaller schools provide smaller classroom size, indicating maybe 
that more teaching assistance provided for the students.
large (2000-5000): 58.26% passing rate
Small/Medium (<1000, 1000-2000): About 89%-91% passing rate

There was no direct correlation between
the amount of money spent per student nor budget in regards to the outcome of overall test 
scores. 


Charter schools outperformed District schools in regards to overall test score; higher 
passing scores in overall passing.
Charter: 90.43% passing 
District: 53.67% passing 

Charter schools perform better that district schools over all. It can be the fact that Charter Schools
are smaller in school size than District Schools.
